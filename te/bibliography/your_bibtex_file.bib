abstract = {We study distributed machine learning in heterogeneous environments in this work. We first conduct a systematic study of existing systems running distributed stochastic gradient descent; we find that, although these systems work well in homogeneous environments, they can suffer performance degradation, sometimes up to 10x, in heterogeneous environments where stragglers are common because their synchronization protocols cannot fit a heterogeneous setting. Our first contribution is a heterogeneity-aware algorithm that uses a constant learning rate schedule for updates before adding them to the global parameter. This allows us to suppress stragglers' harm on robust convergence. As a further improvement, our second contribution is a more sophisticated learning rate schedule that takes into consideration the delayed information of each update. We theoretically prove the valid convergence of both approaches and implement a prototype system in the production cluster of our industrial partner Tencent Inc. We validate the performance of this prototype using a range of machine-learning workloads. Our prototype is 2-12x faster than other state-of-the-art systems, such as Spark, Petuum, and TensorFlow; and our proposed algorithm takes up to 6x fewer iterations to converge.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is very appealing for its privacy benefits: essentially, a global model is trained with updates computed on mobile devices while keeping the data of users local. Standard FL infrastructures are however designed to have no energy or performance impact on mobile devices, and are therefore not suitable for applications that require frequent (online) model updates, such as news recommenders.This paper presents FLeet, the first Online FL system, acting as a middleware between the Android OS and the machine learning application. FLeet combines the privacy of Standard FL with the precision of online learning thanks to two core components: (i) I-Prof, a new lightweight profiler that predicts and controls the impact of learning tasks on mobile devices, and (ii) AdaSGD, a new adaptive learning algorithm that is resilient to delayed updates.Our extensive evaluation shows that Online FL, as implemented by FLeet, can deliver a 2.3\texttimes{} quality boost compared to Standard FL, while only consuming 0.036\% of the battery per day. I-Prof can accurately control the impact of learning tasks by improving the prediction accuracy up to 3.6\texttimes{} (computation time) and up to 19\texttimes{} (energy). AdaSGD outperforms alternative FL approaches by 18.4\% in terms of convergence speed on heterogeneous data.},

For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent. } }

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) on the Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) for healthcare applications is an operative scenario for IoT devices that has gained attention from vast research fields in recent years. The IoT connects all subjects and the healthcare system seamlessly. This paper describes the WBAN based IoT healthcare system and reviews the state-of-the-art of the network architecture topology and applications in the IoT based healthcare solutions. Moreover, this paper analyzes the security and the privacy features consisting of privacy, authentication, energy, power, resource management, Quality of Services and the real-time wireless health monitoring that are quite problematic in many IoT healthcare architectures. Because, system architecture is not well-defined, data restriction and its integrity preservation is still a challenge. At present 90% of the information available is acquired in the recent two years. This survey mainly aims at analyzing healthcare purpose which is based on digital healthcare system. Further, it reports many IoT and the e-healthcare policies and systems that decide how to ease all bearable development. Thus, the overall system provides large possibilities for future research based on IoT healthcare system. Finally, research gaps are reviewed and the possible future aspects have been discussed.}

For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent. } }

We propose Domain-Invariant Component Analysis (DICA), a kernel-based optimization algorithm that learns an invariant transformation by minimizing the dissimilarity across domains, whilst preserving the functional relationship between input and output variables. A learning-theoretic analysis shows that reducing dissimilarity improves the expected generalization ability of classifiers on new domains, motivating the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DICA successfully learns invariant features and improves classifier performance in practice.  }

abstract = {We study distributed machine learning in heterogeneous environments in this work. We first conduct a systematic study of existing systems running distributed stochastic gradient descent; we find that, although these systems work well in homogeneous environments, they can suffer performance degradation, sometimes up to 10x, in heterogeneous environments where stragglers are common because their synchronization protocols cannot fit a heterogeneous setting. Our first contribution is a heterogeneity-aware algorithm that uses a constant learning rate schedule for updates before adding them to the global parameter. This allows us to suppress stragglers' harm on robust convergence. As a further improvement, our second contribution is a more sophisticated learning rate schedule that takes into consideration the delayed information of each update. We theoretically prove the valid convergence of both approaches and implement a prototype system in the production cluster of our industrial partner Tencent Inc. We validate the performance of this prototype using a range of machine-learning workloads. Our prototype is 2-12x faster than other state-of-the-art systems, such as Spark, Petuum, and TensorFlow; and our proposed algorithm takes up to 6x fewer iterations to converge.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is very appealing for its privacy benefits: essentially, a global model is trained with updates computed on mobile devices while keeping the data of users local. Standard FL infrastructures are however designed to have no energy or performance impact on mobile devices, and are therefore not suitable for applications that require frequent (online) model updates, such as news recommenders.This paper presents FLeet, the first Online FL system, acting as a middleware between the Android OS and the machine learning application. FLeet combines the privacy of Standard FL with the precision of online learning thanks to two core components: (i) I-Prof, a new lightweight profiler that predicts and controls the impact of learning tasks on mobile devices, and (ii) AdaSGD, a new adaptive learning algorithm that is resilient to delayed updates.Our extensive evaluation shows that Online FL, as implemented by FLeet, can deliver a 2.3\texttimes{} quality boost compared to Standard FL, while only consuming 0.036\% of the battery per day. I-Prof can accurately control the impact of learning tasks by improving the prediction accuracy up to 3.6\texttimes{} (computation time) and up to 19\texttimes{} (energy). AdaSGD outperforms alternative FL approaches by 18.4\% in terms of convergence speed on heterogeneous data.},

For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent. } }

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) on the Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) for healthcare applications is an operative scenario for IoT devices that has gained attention from vast research fields in recent years. The IoT connects all subjects and the healthcare system seamlessly. This paper describes the WBAN based IoT healthcare system and reviews the state-of-the-art of the network architecture topology and applications in the IoT based healthcare solutions. Moreover, this paper analyzes the security and the privacy features consisting of privacy, authentication, energy, power, resource management, Quality of Services and the real-time wireless health monitoring that are quite problematic in many IoT healthcare architectures. Because, system architecture is not well-defined, data restriction and its integrity preservation is still a challenge. At present 90% of the information available is acquired in the recent two years. This survey mainly aims at analyzing healthcare purpose which is based on digital healthcare system. Further, it reports many IoT and the e-healthcare policies and systems that decide how to ease all bearable development. Thus, the overall system provides large possibilities for future research based on IoT healthcare system. Finally, research gaps are reviewed and the possible future aspects have been discussed.}

For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent. } }

We propose Domain-Invariant Component Analysis (DICA), a kernel-based optimization algorithm that learns an invariant transformation by minimizing the dissimilarity across domains, whilst preserving the functional relationship between input and output variables. A learning-theoretic analysis shows that reducing dissimilarity improves the expected generalization ability of classifiers on new domains, motivating the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DICA successfully learns invariant features and improves classifier performance in practice.  }

ABSTRACT = {Advanced air mobility (AAM) is a broad concept enabling consumers access to on-demand air mobility, cargo and package delivery, healthcare applications, and emergency services through an integrated and connected multimodal transportation network. However, a number of challenges could impact AAM’s growth potential, such as autonomous flight, the availability of take-off and landing infrastructure (i.e., vertiports), integration into airspace and other modes of transportation, and competition with shared automated vehicles. This article discusses the results of a demand analysis examining the market potential of two potential AAM passenger markets—airport shuttles and air taxis. The airport shuttle market envisions AAM passenger service to, from, or between airports along fixed routes. The air taxi market envisions a more mature and scaled service that provides on-demand point-to-point passenger services throughout urban areas. Using a multi-method approach consisting of AAM travel demand modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and constraint analysis, this study estimates that the air taxi and airport shuttle markets could capture a 0.5% mode share. The analysis concludes that AAM could replace non-discretionary trips greater than 45 min; however, demand for discretionary trips would be limited by consumer willingness to pay. This study concludes that AAM passenger services could have a daily demand of 82,000 passengers served by approximately 4000 four- to five-seat aircraft in the U.S., under the most conservative scenario, representing an annual market valuation of 2.5 billion USD.},

ABSTRACT = {Computing devices that can recognize various human activities or movements can be used to assist people in healthcare, sports, or human–robot interaction. Readily available data for this purpose can be obtained from the accelerometer and the gyroscope built into everyday smartphones. Effective classification of real-time activity data is, therefore, actively pursued using various machine learning methods. In this study, the transformer model, a deep learning neural network model developed primarily for the natural language processing and vision tasks, was adapted for a time-series analysis of motion signals. The self-attention mechanism inherent in the transformer, which expresses individual dependencies between signal values within a time series, can match the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks with long short-term memory. The performance of the proposed adapted transformer method was tested on the largest available public dataset of smartphone motion sensor data covering a wide range of activities, and obtained an average identification accuracy of 99.2% as compared with 89.67% achieved on the same data by a conventional machine learning method. The results suggest the expected future relevance of the transformer model for human activity recognition.},

We train policies parameterized by neural networks that are capable of controlling individual drones in a swarm in a fully decentralized manner. Our policies, trained in simulated environments with realistic quadrotor physics, demonstrate advanced flocking behaviors, perform aggressive maneuvers in tight formations while avoiding collisions with each other, break and re-establish formations to avoid collisions with moving obstacles, and efficiently coordinate in pursuit-evasion tasks. We analyze, in simulation, how different model architectures and parameters of the training regime influence the final performance of neural swarms. We demonstrate the successful deployment of the model learned in simulation to highly resource-constrained physical quadrotors performing station keeping and goal swapping behaviors.

ABSTRACT = {A recurrent neural network (RNN) combines variable-length input data with a hidden state that depends on previous time steps to generate output data. RNNs have been widely used in time-series data analysis, and various RNN algorithms have been proposed, such as the standard RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRUs). In particular, it has been experimentally proven that LSTM and GRU have higher validation accuracy and prediction accuracy than the standard RNN. The learning ability is a measure of the effectiveness of gradient of error information that would be backpropagated. This study provided a theoretical and experimental basis for the result that LSTM and GRU have more efficient gradient descent than the standard RNN by analyzing and experimenting the gradient vanishing of the standard RNN, LSTM, and GRU. As a result, LSTM and GRU are robust to the degradation of gradient descent even when LSTM and GRU learn long-range input data, which means that the learning ability of LSTM and GRU is greater than standard RNN when learning long-range input data. Therefore, LSTM and GRU have higher validation accuracy and prediction accuracy than the standard RNN. In addition, it was verified whether the experimental results of river-level prediction models, solar power generation prediction models, and speech signal models using the standard RNN, LSTM, and GRUs are consistent with the analysis results of gradient vanishing.},

  abstract = 	 {We study reinforcement learning for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with infinite observation and state spaces, which remains less investigated theoretically. To this end, we make the first attempt at bridging partial observability and function approximation for a class of POMDPs with a linear structure. In detail, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Optimistic Exploration via Adversarial Integral Equation or OP-TENET) that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal policy within $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ episodes. In particular, the sample complexity scales polynomially in the intrinsic dimension of the linear structure and is independent of the size of the observation and state spaces. The sample efficiency of OP-TENET is enabled by a sequence of ingredients: (i) a Bellman operator with finite memory, which represents the value function in a recursive manner, (ii) the identification and estimation of such an operator via an adversarial integral equation, which features a smoothed discriminator tailored to the linear structure, and (iii) the exploration of the observation and state spaces via optimism, which is based on quantifying the uncertainty in the adversarial integral equation.}

abstract = {Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) has emerged as a pioneering concept designed to optimize the efficacy and ecological sustainability of air transportation. Its core objective is to provide highly automated air transportation services for passengers or cargo, operating at low altitudes within urban, suburban, and rural regions. AAM seeks to enhance the efficiency and environmental viability of the aviation sector by revolutionizing the way air travel is conducted. In a complex aviation environment, traffic management and control are essential technologies for safe and effective AAM operations. One of the most difficult obstacles in the envisioned AAM systems is vehicle coordination at merging points and intersections. The escalating demand for air mobility services, particularly within urban areas, poses significant complexities to the execution of such missions. In this study, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to efficiently manage high-density AAM operations in structured airspace. Our approach provides effective guidance to AAM vehicles, ensuring conflict avoidance, mitigating traffic congestion, reducing travel time, and maintaining safe separation. Specifically, intelligent learning-based algorithms are developed to provide speed guidance for each AAM vehicle, ensuring secure merging into air corridors and safe passage through intersections. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct training and evaluation using BlueSky, an open-source air traffic control simulation environment. Through the simulation of thousands of aircraft and the integration of real-world data, our study demonstrates the promising potential of MARL in enabling safe and efficient AAM operations. The simulation results validate the efficacy of our approach and its ability to achieve the desired outcomes.}

abstract = {Transformer achieves remarkable successes in understanding 1 and 2-dimensional signals (e.g., NLP and Image Content Understanding). As a potential alternative to convolutional neural networks, it shares merits of strong interpretability, high discriminative power on hyper-scale data, and flexibility in processing varying length inputs. However, its encoders naturally contain computational intensive operations such as pair-wise self-attention, incurring heavy computational burden when being applied on the complex 3-dimensional video signals. This paper presents Token Shift Module (i.e., TokShift), a novel, zero-parameter, zero-FLOPs operator, for modeling temporal relations within each transformer encoder. Specifically, the TokShift barely temporally shifts partial [Class] token features back-and-forth across adjacent frames. Then, we densely plug the module into each encoder of a plain 2D vision transformer for learning 3D video representation. It is worth noticing that our TokShift transformer is a pure convolutional-free video transformer pilot with computational efficiency for video understanding. Experiments on standard benchmarks verify its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency. Particularly, with input clips of 8/12 frames, the TokShift transformer achieves SOTA precision: 79.83\%/80.40\% on the Kinetics-400, 66.56\% on EGTEA-Gaze+, and 96.80\% on UCF-101 datasets, comparable or better than existing SOTA convolutional counterparts.

Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L log L) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences’ dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.}, number={12}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Zhou, Haoyi and Zhang, Shanghang and Peng, Jieqi and Zhang, Shuai and Li, Jianxin and Xiong, Hui and Zhang, Wancai}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={11106-11115} }

Since solutions to such problems do not depend on the order of elements of the set, models used to address them should be permutation invariant. We present an attention-based neural network module, the Set Transformer, specifically designed to model interactions among elements in the input set. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which rely on attention mechanisms. In an effort to reduce computational complexity, we introduce an attention scheme inspired by inducing point methods from sparse Gaussian process literature. It reduces the computation time of self-attention from quadratic to linear in the number of elements in the set. We show that our model is theoretically attractive and we evaluate it on a range of tasks, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance compared to recent methods for set-structured data.}
